I am honored to share that I have been awarded the **National Scholarship** (国家奖学金) for the academic year 2024-2025 at Peking University.

The National Scholarship is the highest honor awarded by the Ministry of Education of China to students who demonstrate outstanding academic performance and comprehensive qualities.

Sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported me along the way!.
